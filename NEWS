iModMix 1.0.0
=============

**Initial Release**

- Introduction of `iModMix`, a novel network-based approach that integrates multi-omics data, including metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data.
- Ability to incorporate both identified and unidentified metabolites.
- Functions for loading and preprocessing data, performing partial correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering, and module eigengene calculation.
- Integration of multiple omics datasets to reveal significant associations with phenotypes of interest.
- Visualization tools for dendrograms, module assignments, and network plots.
- Enrichment analysis using gene symbols with support for various databases.

Key Features
------------

- `load_data()`: Function to load and preprocess expression data.
- `partial_cors()`: Function to perform partial correlation analysis using Graphical Lasso.
- `hierarchical_cluster()`: Function to perform hierarchical clustering using TOM or partial correlation matrix.
- `cluster_assignments()`: Function to assign clusters to features based on hierarchical clustering.
- `Eigengenes()`: Function to calculate module eigengenes.
- `perform_classification()`: Function to relate modules to phenotypes using statistical analysis.
- `Modules_correlation()`: Function to integrate multiple omics datasets and calculate correlations.
- `Assigment_genes_enrichr()`: Function to perform enrichment analysis using gene symbols.

- Created documentation and examples for the functions.
- Added vignette to demonstrate the usage of the package.
